#	Physical Design for Hardware Security

##	Problem 1

Some fabless IC/VLSI design companies use split manufacturing as a defense
	against untrusted foundries in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
	This defense mechanism protects the intellectual property against the
		following attack scenarios.

Attack scenarios:
+ Reverse engineering
+ Chip recycling
+ Overproduction

Given the bottom/lower layers of the layout for an integrated circuit (for
	the front-end-of-line, FEOL, semiconductor manufacturing process), or
	VLSI system, design attacks that can determine the top layers of the layout.
	These top-layers are manufactured by back-end-of-line (BEOL) semiconductor
		manufacturing process.
